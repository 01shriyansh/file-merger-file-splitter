# file-merger-file-splitter
this java program is for splitting a file into small components for example there is a file a.txt and is of size 1000bytes
then if we want to split it into 10 files each of 100 bytes,this program will do that and create a(1).txt,a(2).txt,...... and so on.
If we want orignal file again then we can use file merger program and it will get a(1).txt,a(2).txt......as input and will give a.txt
as output.
